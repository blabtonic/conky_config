# Conky Config
saving custom conky config (located at /etc/conky/conky.conf)

Configuration file is using lua to put in the data for conky to run this build is using Conky 1.10.8 for Linux 4.4.0-101 x86_64. Expect this to work for many versions of linux(had it running on manjaro awhile ago as well). The Spotify section only works when spotify desktop client is running when the client goes to any other device (ie. bluetooth speaker, alexa speaker etc) the section will appear blank might be a bug haven't looked into it.
